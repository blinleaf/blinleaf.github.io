Hi, there! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by [Prof. Dahua Lin](https://dahua.site/). Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. degree with honors from the Experimental Program for Exemplary Engineers at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) in June 2025.

My research interests mainly lies in embodied AI and 3D computer vision :eyes:. Always open to collaboration or discussion—feel free to reach out via Email or WeChat :speech_balloon:. <span style="color: orange;">Let's make our physical world more interactive!</span>
